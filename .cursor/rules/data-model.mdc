The application uses a Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database. Core models include:

## Main Entities

- **InventoryItem**: Core model representing products in inventory with integrated stock tracking
  - Contains fields for name, description, SKU, cost, price, margin, stock quantity
  - Connected to Category via one-to-many relationship

- **Category**: Used to organize products into categories 
  - Simple model with name and description
  - One category can have many inventory items

- **StockMovement**: Tracks all changes to inventory levels
  - Records quantity, date, type of movement and notes
  - Connected to InventoryItem via foreign key

- **Sale**: Represents a sales transaction with items sold and revenue
  - Records date, amount, payment method, status

## Key Relationships

- Each InventoryItem belongs to one Category (optional)
- Each InventoryItem can have multiple StockMovements
- Sales contain references to the products sold
