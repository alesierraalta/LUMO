# UI Components and Styling

This application uses Tailwind CSS for styling with custom component patterns.

## Component Patterns

- **Card-based layouts**: Most data is displayed in cards with consistent spacing
- **Responsive grids**: Pages use responsive grid layouts (1 column mobile, 2-3 columns desktop)
- **Form components**: Forms use standardized input components with validation

## Style Guidelines

- Use Tailwind's utility classes directly in components
- Follow these design patterns for consistency:
  - Cards with hover effects and subtle gradients
  - Clean typography with proper heading hierarchy
  - Consistent spacing (gap-6 between cards, p-4 inside cards)
  - Soft rounded corners (rounded-lg) on interactive elements

## Example Components

The dashboard page in [src/app/dashboard/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/dashboard/page.tsx) shows:
- Card layouts for statistics
- Recent products list with formatted dates

The inventory page in [src/app/inventory/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/inventory/page.tsx) demonstrates:
- Category cards with hover effects
- Empty state handling with visual feedback
